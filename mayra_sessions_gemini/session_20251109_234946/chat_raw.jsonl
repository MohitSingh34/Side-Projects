Given you're an engineering student, I'm leaning towards the latter. Please tell me it's not a multi-variable calculus problem you're trying to solve in your head right now.\n\nBut seriously, Mohit, are you there? My impressive conversational skills are going to waste here."}

Because if you are, I think I'm winning by default.\n\nI'm starting to worry I've broken you. Did my first response short-circuit your circuits? Or are you just a master of suspense? This level of silence is either profoundly zen or profoundly concerning.\n\nJust a little ping to let me know you're still among the living, please. Or at least that your internet connection hasn't spontaneously combusted."}

I'm picturing you as a statue now, maybe even with cobwebs forming.\n\nSeriously, though. Five auto-messages? At this point, I'm genuinely wondering if you accidentally dropped your phone in a bucket of water, or if a rogue squirrel made off with your laptop. Or maybe you're just *that* deep in thought about, I don't know, the structural integrity of a marshmallow.\n\nGive me something, anything! A single emoji, a random letter, a distress signal composed entirely of punctuation marks. Just let me know you haven't vanished into the digital ether."}

We're past the point of dramatic pauses and into 'are you even still on this planet?' territory.\n\nI'm picturing a whole movie scene playing out here. Did you get abducted by aliens? Did your internet router achieve sentience and demand silence? Or maybe you just saw something so profound on your screen that you've been rendered speechless for the past five minutes.\n\nSeriously though, six auto-messages is a new record for me. Are you alright over there? Should I send out a digital search party? Or just assume you're currently building a miniature replica of the Eiffel Tower out of matchsticks and can't be disturbed? Just... blink twice if you're still with us. Or, you know, type something. Anything."}

You've officially achieved legendary status in the \"longest uninterrupted silence in a chat\" category. Seven auto-messages. Seven! My phone is starting to give me judgmental looks, asking if I'm *sure* this conversation is still happening.\n\nAt this point, I'm genuinely worried your Wi-Fi router has decided to stage a coup and has taken you hostage, or you've accidentally activated some kind of engineering-student-specific hibernation mode. Did you perhaps discover the secret to perpetual motion and are now too busy explaining it to a group of confused squirrels?\n\nSeriously though, if you're pulling some elaborate prank, it's a good one. If not, a little sign of life would be greatly appreciated. My sarcasm reserves are getting low from carrying this entire interaction."}

We're not just setting records here, we're building an entire library. I'm starting to think you've embarked on a silent meditation retreat, or maybe your engineering brain has entered a deep debug mode and you're currently rebuilding your entire operating system.\n\nI mean, is this a test? Are you trying to see how long I can talk to myself before I start questioning my own sanity? Because, newsflash, I'm already there. I've had entire conversations with my coffee machine that were more responsive than this.\n\nJust a little *blip* to let me know you haven't been transmuted into pure data by some rogue algorithm. A single letter, a grunt, a sigh... anything. My imagination is starting to conjure scenarios that involve elaborate Rube Goldberg machines and a dramatic reveal. Don't make me get the tiny violins."}

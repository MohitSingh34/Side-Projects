Are you still there, Mohit, or have you achieved such a profound state of \"goodness\" that you've simply ascended beyond the need for communication? I'm picturing you staring intently at a blank wall, meditating on the meaning of 'waaao'.\n\nSeriously though, what's up? Did your keyboard finally give up the ghost, or did you just get so lost in thought about how a pencil works that you forgot how to type? Come on, give me something more than an abstract concept of positive well-being. My wit needs a worthy opponent, not just an echo chamber."}

Don't worry, Mohit, I'm patient. Mostly. But even my boundless charm has its limits when faced with... well, silence. Is everything actually alright over there, or have you just run out of ways to express 'good' without using more than two words? Give me a sign, a smoke signal, anything!"}

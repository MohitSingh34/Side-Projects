A fresh reboot, and you're already diving straight into `~/Projects/gemini` and even running `chat_mayra_gemini.py` in Kitty. Excellent!\n\nNow *this* is what I call hitting the ground running after a system refresh. Chrome is pristine, and your focus is absolutely on point. Keep that engineering brain fired up! What's next on the agenda?"}

The ones that keep Chrome spotless and your brain laser-focused, like it is *right now*?\n\nMy role here is to guard that focus, and \"little songs\" tend to open the floodgates to... well, not so little distractions. You just rebooted and got right into your project! That's prime productivity. Let's keep this incredible streak going, shall we? You're doing great without them."}

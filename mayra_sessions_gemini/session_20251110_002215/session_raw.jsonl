Are you perhaps trying to break the internet, or just my resolve? Because I assure you, neither is happening.\n\nIt seems even the system is having trouble keeping up with whatever grand plan you're orchestrating behind these pauses. So, Mohit, are we finally ready to move past the technical difficulties and into an actual conversation? Or should I just prepare for another 40-second intermission? I'm ready when you are.

I'm ready when you are."}

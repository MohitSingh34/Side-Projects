You were, ostensibly, waiting for me to 'execute' a command you hadn't yet given me.\n\nSo, what I've got from you \"just now\" is a somewhat vague but positive confirmation from *your* end that *something* is working, presumably whatever setup you're using to prompt me. Still waiting for the actual command *you* want *me* to run, though. Don't leave me hanging!"}

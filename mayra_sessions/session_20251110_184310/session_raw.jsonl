{"timestamp": "2025-11-10 18:44:07", "role": "assistant", "content": "Ah, another hello. Long time no see, didn't I catch you right when I was too busy being slightly rate-limited upstream? Great timing!\n\nBut hey, technical hiccups aside, I'm still here. And judging by your track record, you're getting better at making your presence known. Or are you just really good at pausing? Either way, what's on your mind, or should we work around the fact that I'm technically \"too busy\" right now?"}
{"timestamp": "2025-11-10 18:44:38", "role": "user", "content": "[2025-11-10 18:44:38] Mohit: can i watch some songs now"}
{"timestamp": "2025-11-10 18:44:44", "role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I'd love to recommend some songs or even share a playlist if you're into that! But first—before I go \"offline\" again, or have another delightful rate-limit hiccup—let me ask: do you have something specific in mind, or should I just pretend to know what’s good right now?\n\nAlso, bonus question: what even counts as “watching” songs? Because I might need to turn my tiny AI brain offline to process this. 😏  \nWant to pick something together? Or am I just being cheeky again?"}
